Discovering Human-readable Rules to Predict Effective Compiler Settings for
Embedded Software" by Craig Blackmore, Oliver Ray and Kerstin Eder.

CProgol4.4 is required to run the Progol scripts (it can be obtained from
http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~shm/progol.html).

This study used benchmark programs from the Bristol/Embecosm Embedded Benchmark
Suite (BEEBS), which is available at http://beebs.eu.

Directory structure:
  examples.pl - examples for the predicate badFlag/2
  hotIR.pl    - IR for each program (extracted using Milepost GCC)
  progs.pl    - programs used in these experiments
  train.pl    - training script
  rules.pl    - output from running 'progol train.pl rules.pl'
